# Portfolio-Project---Recommendation-Software
Codecademy Python Portfolio Project - create recommendation software using python

For my Portfolio Project recommendation software using Python, I decided to create a recommendation software for movies. 
With the movie data I entered the user can get movie recommedations depending on how they search.
The user can look by movie genre, movie rating and alphabetically.
